# TVC-GUI
A working Repo for the SDSU Rocket Project Galactic Aztec Heavy nascent TVC subsystem, which attemps to use seperate threads for GUI creation/updating and networking with the Motor Controller/Raspberry Pi/ADC unit.


Current Issues:

  Not sure what the best plotting routine for the X and Y positions are. Scatter plots seem to create lots of lag.
  Graphs are not sticky - expanding the GUI doesn't keep the plots on the borders.
