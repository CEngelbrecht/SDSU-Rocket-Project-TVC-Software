# TVC-GUI
A working repo for the SDSU Rocket Project Galactic Aztec Heavy nascent TVC subsystem.

This contains the scripts for the motor controller/actuator and ADC/Pi units, as well as the client GUI software. 

Current client Issues:

Very resource intensive. Plotting is slow.

Current server issues: 

Need testing of routine calls on physical setup. 
Add more routines.
