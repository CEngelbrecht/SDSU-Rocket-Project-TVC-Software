# TVC-GUI
A working repo for the SDSU Rocket Project Galactic Aztec Heavy nascent TVC subsystem.

This contains the scripts for the motor controller/actuator and ADC/Pi units, as well as the client GUI software. 

Dependencies: 
Roboclaw.py, the library from IonMotion that'll control our Motor Controller
ABElectronics libraries: specifically the ABE_Helpers.py and ABE_ADCPi. These interface with the ADC currently mounted on the ADC in the TVCBey

Current client Issues:

Need to prettify it.
Add the current X and Y labels
Change the animation. Is red cross alright for location?

Current server issues:
