# TVC-GUI
A working repo for the SDSU Rocket Project Galactic Aztec Heavy nascent TVC subsystem.

There will shortly be both the scripts for the motor controller/actuator and ADC/Pi units, as well as the client GUI software. 


Current GUI Issues:

Not sure what the best plotting routine for the X and Y positions are. Scatter plots seem to create lots of lag.
Graphs are not sticky - expanding the GUI doesn't keep the plots on the borders.
The threading doesn't work as planned. The .after call in the Threaded Client Class doesnâ€™t choke the data stream coming  in.
It simply stalls for the specified time instead of calling the queue in the required intervals
